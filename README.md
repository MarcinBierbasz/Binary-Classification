Project is my attempt on classic Titanic dataset analysis and survival prediction.

Main objective of analysis was to predict whether passenger who was on the Titanic has survived disaster or not. For this purpose I made all the necessery steps, including data cleansing, handling missing values, performing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, choosing model and tuning it's hyperparameters.

Train and test datasets were downloaded from Kaggle's Titanic competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

I also validated my test set predictions on competition's website and got 78,5% accuracy.
